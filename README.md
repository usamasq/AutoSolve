# AutoSolve - Automatic Camera Tracking for Blender

> **A personal project by Usama Bin Shahid**  
> _Dedicated to my students, with ❤️ from Pakistan 🇵🇰_

> [!IMPORTANT] > **🧪 Research Beta** - This addon is in active development and features a **learning system** that improves tracking quality over time.
>
> **How it works:**
>
> 1.  **Learns Locally:** It learns from your tracking sessions to improve its own settings on your machine.
> 2.  **Community Driven:** You can **optionally share your data** to help train the community model.
>
> **[Contribute your data](#contribute-training-data)** to help build the best open-source tracking algorithm!

AutoSolve is a Blender addon that **automates the entire camera tracking workflow** - from feature detection to camera solve. It uses **adaptive learning** to improve tracking quality over time by learning from each session.

## What It Does

| Step                     | Manual Workflow                               | AutoSolve                                                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Feature Detection** | Place markers manually or use Detect Features | ✅ Smart detection with balanced region coverage           |
| **2. Tracking**          | Track forward/backward, fix lost markers      | ✅ Bidirectional tracking with automatic replenishment     |
| **3. Track Cleanup**     | Delete short/bad tracks manually              | ✅ Automatic filtering of jittery, short, and spike tracks |
| **4. Camera Solve**      | Run solver, hope for low error                | ✅ Iterative refinement with failure diagnosis             |
| **5. Learning**          | Remember what worked                          | ✅ Learns settings that work for your footage types        |

> **Note:** AutoSolve uses Blender's native tracking - no external dependencies required.

## Features

| Feature                    | Description                                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One-Click Tracking**     | Automatic feature detection, tracking, cleanup, and solve |
| **Adaptive Learning**      | Learns optimal settings from your footage over time       |
| **Smart Detection**        | Balanced marker placement across all screen regions       |
| **Bidirectional Tracking** | Starts from mid-clip for better frame coverage            |
| **Quality Prediction**     | Estimates solve quality before running solver             |
| **Failure Diagnosis**      | Detects why tracking failed and applies targeted fixes    |
| **Footage Type Presets**   | Optimized settings for DRONE, INDOOR, HANDHELD, etc.      |

---

## Requirements

- **Blender 4.2.0** or later
- No external dependencies (uses Blender's native tracking only)

---

## Installation

1. Download from the **Blender Extensions Platform**
2. In Blender: `Edit → Preferences → Add-ons`
3. Click **"Install from Disk"** and select the file
4. Enable the extension

---

## Usage

1. Open the **VFX Workspace** in Blender
2. Load footage in the **Movie Clip Editor**
3. Open the **AutoSolve** panel in the sidebar (N)
4. Select a **Footage Type** (or leave on AUTO)
5. Click **Analyze & Solve**
6. Wait for tracking to complete (progress shown in panel)

### Options

| Option           | Purpose                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Footage Type** | Hint for footage characteristics (DRONE, INDOOR, etc.) |
| **Tripod Mode**  | For stationary camera with rotational movement only    |
| **Robust Mode**  | More aggressive settings for difficult footage         |

## How You Can Help

I'm a solo developer making professional camera tracking accessible to everyone.

**Join the community:** [Discord](https://discord.gg/kkAmxKsS)

### 1. Test and Report Issues

- **Found a bug?** Open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/AutoSolve/issues)
- **Feature request?** Share on [Discord](https://discord.gg/kkAmxKsS)

### 2. Contribute Training Data

AutoSolve gets smarter through community data. Your anonymized tracking sessions help improve defaults for everyone.

**How to share your data:**

1. In Blender: `Movie Clip Editor → AutoSolve → Training Data → Export`
2. Share on [Discord](https://discord.gg/kkAmxKsS) or email: `usamasq@gmail.com`

**What's collected:**

- ✅ Settings used (pattern size, correlation, etc.)
- ✅ Success/failure metrics per region
- ✅ Solve error and track statistics
- ❌ NO file paths, images, or personal data

### 3. Contribute Code

## Data for Training

Want to help build the best tracking algorithm? Here's how to collect quality training data:

### Optimal Footage for Training

| Type                      | Examples                | Why Useful                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Varied motion**         | Handheld, gimbal, drone | Tests different search sizes |
| **Different resolutions** | 720p, 1080p, 4K         | Tests scaling behavior       |
| **Challenging scenes**    | Low light, motion blur  | Tests robust mode            |
| **Clean plates**          | Studio, VFX shoots      | Baseline performance         |

### Labeling Your Data

When exporting, add context to your email:

```
Footage: Drone beach flyover
Resolution: 4K
FPS: 24
Result: Success / Fail
Notes: Required 2 retries, edges struggled
```
