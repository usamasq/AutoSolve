## 2024-05-23 - [Optimized Deduplication with Spatial Hashing]
**Learning:** O(N^2) pairwise comparisons for spatial proximity can be drastically reduced by pre-grouping elements into spatial buckets (regions). In `deduplicate_tracks`, grouping tracks by their 9 regions changed complexity from O(N^2) to O(N + sum(k^2)) where k is tracks per region.
**Action:** Always look for spatial bucketing opportunities when comparing proximity of many objects. Avoid re-calculating region/position data inside nested loops.
